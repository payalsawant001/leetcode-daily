# Zigzag Conversion

The string `"PAYPALISHIRING"` is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this (shown with fixed spacing for clarity):

P   A   H   N  
A P L S I I G  
Y   I   R  

And then read line by line: `"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"`

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

```cpp
string convert(string s, int numRows);
